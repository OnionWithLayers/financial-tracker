# Financial Tracker

### Intro:
    This is my first Year Up capstone project. As the title suggests, it's a financial tracker program.
    With this program you can track the deposits and payments of money you make while also keeping 
    track of when it happened.

## Special Feature
    Some things that I think are pretty cool in this program are the colors I incorpor-
    ated in the text and the little animated text I have for some of the options.
    But my favorite thing has to be that I tried to give the program a little personality
    so instead of just giving information to the user, it's as if it's telling you some-
    thing.

## Setup
- In order to run this program on your computer, you will need IntelliJ and GitBash on your computer.
- Then clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/OnionWithLayers/financial-tracker.git cd financial-tracker
- Next compile the code: javac FinancialTracker.java
- Run the Application: java FinancialTracker
## Future Work
    The biggest thing I would like to improve on in this program is the organization. I only have 2 classes for
    this project and I think it would have helped if there were more classes to help myself navigate through 
    everything.
    Another improvement I would make is change how accessible the user input would be regarding the payments and 
    deposits. I tried to make it a little simpler by having the user type in the date and time components seperately,
    but I would like to make it so that the user would be given a fill-in-the-blank type of format so the user can
    input the information quicker and more efficiently.
    I would also like to give the program little functioning emojis that made it seem like the app had more per-
    sonality since I think that it would be boring if it was just information. Another thing would be the pacing 
    of information displayed. I tried to work around some of it by adding a small animated text, but I figured
    it didn't seem quite appropriate to add it into every section.
