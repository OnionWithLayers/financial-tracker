# Financial Tracker

### Intro:
    This is my first Year Up capstone project. As the title suggests, it's a financial tracker program.
    With this program you can track the deposits and payments of money you make while also keeping 
    track of when it happened.

## Setup
- In order to run this program on your computer, you will need IntelliJ and GitBash on your computer.
- Then clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/OnionWithLayers/financial-tracker.git cd financial-tracker
- Next compile the code: javac FinancialTracker.java
- Run the Application: java FinancialTracker
## Future Work
    To improve this program what I would do is change how accessible the user input would be for 
    information regarding the payments and deposits. I tried to make it a little simpler by having the 
    user type in the date and time components seperately, but I would like to make it so that the user would be 
    given a fill-in-the-blank type of format so the user can input the information quicker and more efficiently.
    I would also like to give the program little functioning emojis that made it seem like the app had more per-
    sonality since I think that it would be boring if it was just information. Another thing would be the pacing 
    of information displayed. I tried to work around some of it by adding a small "loading..." text, but I 
    figured it didn't see quite appropriate to add it into every section.
